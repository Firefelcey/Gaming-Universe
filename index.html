                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    The Tomb Raider series began its journey in 1996 with the release of the original game by Core Design. It quickly garnered critical acclaim for its innovative 3D platforming, intricate puzzles, and the charismatic protagonist, Lara Croft. The initial games established a formula that would define the genre for years.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    Over the years, the franchise saw several iterations and developers. Eidos Interactive oversaw many titles, and Crystal Dynamics took the reins in 2006 with "Tomb Raider: Legend," revitalizing the series with improved controls and a more cinematic approach. The most significant shift came with the 2013 reboot, simply titled "Tomb Raider," which reimagined Lara as a younger, more vulnerable survivor, thrust into a harrowing origin story. This trilogy, developed by Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, brought a grittier, more realistic tone to the series, focusing on survival and character development.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    Today, Tomb Raider continues to evolve, with new games, comics, and films expanding its universe, cementing Lara Croft's place as one of gaming's most enduring and beloved characters.
